   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the TStore documentation!
======================================

The **TStore** is a Python package designed to make your life easier, whether you aim TODO.
Our goal is to empower you to focus more on what you can discover and create with the data, rather than getting bogged down by the process of handling it.

With our software, you can:

1. **TODO**: Quickly search and download the data you need.

2. **TODO**: Find the downloaded files on your local storage without digging through folders.


We're excited to see how you'll use this tool to push the boundaries of what's possible, all while making your workflow smoother, enjoyable, and more productive.
